So i refer to 
 setuid and setgid (short for set user identity and set group identity
and the (in) famous sticky bit.

so with setuid you are non owner can run the prog with owner prvileges.
setguid is the same but referring to group privileges.

There's proviso thoguh, the rpog cannot be scripts as in the y must be bnaries!

>>> sticky bit
numeric sticky bit is "1" or "+t"
 I think maybe it's best use-case is setting it for a directory
which means that no files can be  deleted or (even) renamed unless you are owner
or, (if normal permissions allow it) groupowner.

I was trying to memorize the "1" part as having "echoes" of an executable
but actually it doesn't, that would better suit SUID which is 4.
So perhaps, you could say, the "1" is the opposite of what you'd think!


>> setuid & 
the SUID/setuid bit is 4 and the setgid is 2.
