After a fair few timed exam practice sessions
(90 questions in 90 inutes)

I was was getting the hang of them and sometimes I'd finish 90 before the time

Here are some worries i had

I was initially shocked to herar I would not be able to use manpages
many of the uestion in Suehring required that I look up the manpages

I also had come up with theis logic and letting hte student consultant say mapages  or even the internet
is not such a big allowance becuas e the xam is time based, and you only get a question per minute.

So you could waste a lot of time looking up manpages makg it all self-defeating.

But it now turns out, nipe you do not get manpages, so it all has tom come from your head. OH DEAR.

But then I thought, OK, so you will have extra time then.

but then this comment I had seen twice came up, th e questions are quit e long and twisted.

again it comes up here:

So will it have these silly names in the question which are so distracting.


The marking/scoring is not plain

s my idea of marking myself - well, that's not going to work out either.
