Iwrote some notes about selinux
and though short they seem to cpature the overal picture quite well.

syntax is found on these three things (URT) in order: User, Role, Type.

the motivation for T Type is that each program has different types of
of resources. FIrts and most obvious is the execuatable . exec_t
but these are also config files, i.e. conf_t or (in some cases)
ports: port_t for ssh for example.

As well as URT, labels are a big thing in SELinux.

And that was it!
