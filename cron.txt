Wikipedia has a good entry on this

the biggest bugbear is always what the 5 placed asterisks represent

i.e.
  * * * * * <command to execute>

# | | | | |
# | | | | day of the week (0–6) (Sunday to Saturday; 
# | | | month (1–12)             7 is also Sunday on some systems)
# | | day of the month (1–31)
# | hour (0–23)
# minute (0–59)

so you could write them as

min hour dom mon dow

an asterisk means "once for each of this subdivision"
so the first asterisk stands for "every minute"

The spirit of the integers when it's not an asterisk
is for a SINGLE specific value of that subdivsion.
so 30 in the minute place is for the thirtieth minute, i.e. half past.
i.e. assuming hours as *, this will be once every hour, as 30 minutes past.

Actually, you can specify more than 1, by comma separated integers.
i.e. 15,45 * * * * cmd
would be twice every hour, everyday.

Of course that's twice and in similar fashion you can specify a few more.
*/10 for minutes would be every 10 minutes, so it's equivalent to 0,10,20,30,40,50

NOTE Don't be thinking that */10 in the minute column is sub-minutes,
it is NOT. You have to resort to tricks to do subminute, and so these are awkward.
