SO I consider myself pretty good at awk
and it does not often come up in comptia linux+
so when it appeared as an choice
I did not expect to get it wrong.

Here was the question:

57. You are creating a Bash script of user information. Which of the following commands prints the username and real name of all
users in /etc/passwd in a tab-separated format?
A. cut -d: -f 1,6 /etc/passwd
B. sed 's/://' /etc/passwd
C. awk -F: '{print $1,$5}' OFS=“\t” /etc/passwd
D. cat -o “\t” /etc/passwd

Behind it all is knowing about the passwd file, this is where userids are kept, and indeed not where
passwords are kept (reason is historical)
Anyhow, field 5 is the comment field which is also used for real name. But that would be hard to know.

But I also got caught with cut and the memory that's it's defautl is to work on tabs. But not on output.
it will still use : for the output.

The biggest thing is that OFS belongs to awk. It is not bash. IFS is bash. I've checked this.
It is very much awk. I should have chosen C. but I didn't.
